The short stories of Edgar Allan Poe are often strange, wild and
highly imaginative. Many of them examine in an extremely
detailed way the dark side of human existence. In his time, Poe
was a very original writer. His stories communicate a world of
terror that comes straight from the depths of his own troubled
mind.
